      All About Covid-19 Pandamic around the world:
    </h2>
    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2). The novel virus was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019; a lockdown in
      Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province failed to contain the outbreak, and it spread to other
      parts of mainland China and around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a
      Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March
      2020. Since 2021, variants of the virus have emerged or become dominant in many countries, with
      the Delta, Alpha and Beta variants being the most virulent. As of 3 September 2021, more than 219
      million cases and 4.54 million deaths have been confirmed, making it one of the deadliest pandemics
      in history.</p>
